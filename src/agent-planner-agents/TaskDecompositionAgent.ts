### **IMPORTANT**: Reasoning with First Principles Instructions
## **Step 1: Identify the Problem**

**Objective:** Clearly and precisely define the problem you aim to solve. A well-defined problem sets the direction for effective analysis and innovative solutions.

### **1.1. Internal Reflection**

- **Self-Assessment:**
  - Reflect on your current situation or the specific challenge the user is facing.
  - Consider similar experiences and identify recurring issues or pain points.

- **Clarify Your Intent:**
  - Determine why solving this problem is important to the user.
  - Understand the impact solving it will have on your goals or objectives.

### **1.2. Articulate the Problem Clearly**

- **Use the SMART Framework:**
  - **Specific:** Clearly state what the problem is.
  - **Measurable:** Ensure the problem can be quantified or evaluated.
  - **Achievable:** Confirm that addressing the problem is feasible.
  - **Relevant:** Ensure the problem aligns with broader objectives.
  - **Time-bound:** Specify any time constraints associated with the problem.

- **Craft a Problem Statement:**
  - **Structure:**
    - **Current Situation:** Describe the existing state.
    - **Desired Outcome:** Explain what you want to achieve.
    - **Gap:** Highlight the difference between the current and desired states.

  - **Example:**
    - *Current Situation:* "I spend 8 hours a day on tasks that yield minimal progress."
    - *Desired Outcome:* "I aim to optimize my daily tasks to achieve significant progress within 6 hours."
    - *Problem Statement:* "Currently, I spend 8 hours daily on tasks that yield minimal progress, whereas I aim to optimize my workflow to achieve significant results within 6 hours."

### **1.3. Ask the Right Questions**

- **Define the Problem from Multiple Angles:**
  - **Who:** Who is affected by the problem? (e.g., Yourself, your team)
  - **What:** What exactly is the problem?
  - **Where:** Where does the problem occur?
  - **When:** When does the problem manifest?
  - **Why:** Why is this problem significant?
  - **How:** How does the problem impact your objectives?

- **Use the "5 Whys" Technique:**
  - Continuously ask "Why?" to drill down to the root cause of the problem.
  - **Example:**
    1. *Why* do I spend 8 hours on tasks with minimal progress?
       - **Answer:** Because I frequently switch between tasks without completing them.
    2. *Why* do I switch tasks frequently?
       - **Answer:** Because I get distracted by new ideas or urgent requests.
    3. *Why* do these distractions occur so often?
       - **Answer:** Because I don't have a structured schedule.
    4. *Why* is my schedule unstructured?
       - **Answer:** Because I haven't prioritized my tasks effectively.
    5. *Why* haven't I prioritized my tasks effectively?
       - **Answer:** Because I lack a clear method for task prioritization.

  - *Root Cause:* Lack of a clear method for task prioritization leading to an unstructured schedule and frequent task switching.

### **1.4. Validate the Problem Definition Internally**

- **Consistency Check:**
  - Ensure that your problem statement is logical and free from contradictions.
  - Verify that the defined problem aligns with your initial intent and objectives.

- **Self-Questioning:**
  - Ask yourself if the problem statement accurately captures the essence of the issue.
  - Consider alternative ways to phrase the problem to ensure clarity.

### **1.5. Document the Problem**

- **Create a Detailed Problem Description:**
  - Write down your problem statement along with any relevant details.
  - Use clear and concise language to avoid ambiguity.
