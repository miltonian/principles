# Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system designed to generate specialized agents for determining appropriate boundaries for microservices within a distributed architecture. The system employs a structured framework comprising multiple analysis stages and adheres to best practices, including domain-driven design (DDD) principles. By leveraging a series of interconnected agents, the system ensures that each microservice is well-defined, scalable, and maintainable.

## User Objective

The primary objective of the user is to **generate specialized agents** that establish appropriate boundaries for microservices within a distributed architecture. This involves conducting a series of analyses and evaluations to ensure that each microservice:

- Is well-defined
- Is scalable
- Is maintainable

The generated agents will operate within a framework consisting of multiple analysis stages and best practices, addressing key components such as:

- User requirements
- System identification
- Service interactions
- Scalability
- Domain-driven design principles

## System Process

The system operates through a sequential and collaborative process involving multiple agents, each responsible for specific tasks that contribute to defining optimal microservice boundaries. The process can be broken down into the following stages:

1. **Requirement Elicitation**
2. **Domain Identification**
3. **Bounded Context Definition**
4. **Entity and Relationship Analysis**
5. **Microservice Boundary Determination**
6. **Scalability and Performance Evaluation**
7. **Inter-Service Communication Analysis**
8. **Data Management Strategy**
9. **Maintainability Assessment**
10. **Final Recommendation Compilation**

Each stage is managed by a dedicated agent that processes inputs, performs analyses, and produces structured outputs to inform subsequent stages.
